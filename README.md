A Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focused on **scraping, cleaning, and analyzing Colombian news** from multiple sources (_El Espectador, Semana, El Colombiano_) to uncover patterns in **topics, sentiment, and named entities**.  
The goal is to transform a large and fragmented corpus of news into a **structured map of trends, emotions, and key actors** in the Colombian media landscape.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Every day, hundreds of news articles are published in Colombia across multiple outlets, making it difficult to obtain a clear and unbiased overview of the national agenda.  
This project centralizes that information by:

- **Scraping** thousands of news articles.
- **Cleaning & preprocessing** the text corpus.
- Applying **NLP techniques** for:
  - Thematic classification (10 main categories).
  - Sentiment analysis (BETO, 5+1 classes).
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER).

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- **News Scraping** â†’ Automated collection of news articles from different sources.  
- **Preprocessing Pipeline** â†’ Tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal, handling of accents and casing.  
- **Text Representations**:
  - Bag of Words (BoW)
  - TF-IDF
  - Sentence-BERT embeddings  
- **Supervised Classification**:
  - MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)
  - Linear SVM
  - Random Forest  
- **Sentiment Analysis**:
  - BETO pre-trained model (`ignacio-ave/beto-sentiment-analysis-spanish`) with HuggingFace
  - Sliding window strategy for long news (>512 tokens)
- **NER Exploration**:
  - Entity extraction (PER, ORG, LOC, MISC)
  - Interactive filtering by category & time period  

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings

- **Topic Distribution**: News are heavily biased towards politics and society (~40%), while economy and regions are underrepresented.  
- **Model Performance**:
  - **TF-IDF + SVM** achieved the best accuracy (**76%**).
  - BoW and BERT embeddings performed lower (61â€“72%).  
- **Sentiment**: The corpus shows a **predominantly negative tone**, especially towards political figures (e.g., Gustavo Petro, Miguel Uribe Turbay).  
- **NER**: Key entities include politicians, institutions (FiscalÃ­a, Centro DemocrÃ¡tico), and major cities (BogotÃ¡, MedellÃ­n, Washington).

## ðŸ“ˆ Example Visualizations

- **Sentiment evolution over time** â†’ smoothed with moving averages.  
- **Word clouds, bigrams & trigrams** â†’ to uncover frequent narratives.  
- **Confusion matrices** â†’ model performance by class.  
- **Violin plots** â†’ distribution of sentiment confidence scores.  
- **Interactive NER explorer** â†’ entity frequency by category and time.

## ðŸ”® Future Work

- Fine-tuning transformer-based models (BETO, mBERT, RoBERTa).  
- Explore topic modeling (LDA, BERTopic) for unsupervised theme discovery.  
- Expand corpus with social media (Twitter, Reddit, forums).  
- Apply **active learning** for iterative and more robust labeling.  
- Integrate visualization dashboards (Streamlit or Plotly Dash).
